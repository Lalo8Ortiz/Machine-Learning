In this folder, you will find some projects where I practiced with different models of varying complexity.

Proyect 9 [📡 Megaline Plan Recommendation](https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Proyecto_9_Compa%C3%B1ia_Movil_Megaline(Introduccion_Machine_Learning)  
🚀 *Predicting the best mobile plan (Smart or Ultra) for Megaline customers based on their usage behavior

Proyect 10 [🏦 Beta Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/Machine-Learning/blob/main/P10_Clientes_Beta_Bank_(aprendizaje_supervisado)_.ipynb)  
🔍 *Predicting whether a customer will leave the bank using past behavior data and contract termination history.*  

To help **Beta Bank** retain customers, this project develops a **classification model** to predict customer churn.  
The objective is to **maximize the F1-score**, ensuring a minimum threshold of **0.59** for approval.  

📊 Additionally, the **AUC-ROC metric** is measured and compared with the **F1-score** to evaluate model performance. 

Proyect 11 [⛽ OilyGiant Oil Well Selection]([OilyGiant/oil_well_model.ipynb](https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/Machine-Learning/blob/main/P11_Extraccion_de_pozos_Aprendizaje_automatico.ipynb))  
🔍 *Identifying the most profitable locations to open 200 new oil wells using predictive modeling and risk analysis.*  

As an analyst for **OilyGiant**, the goal is to **predict oil reserves** in new wells and select the most profitable locations.  
This project follows these key steps:  

✔ **Analyze crude oil quality and reserve volumes** in three regions.  
✔ **Develop a machine learning model** to predict oil reserve volumes.  
✔ **Select the top 200 wells** with the highest estimated reserves.  
✔ **Identify the most profitable region** for investment.  
✔ **Assess risks and potential profits using bootstrapping.**  

📊 The analysis ensures **data-driven decision-making** for maximizing OilyGiant's profitability while managing risk.
